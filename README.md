# N Queen Problem
> Learning and practicing programming languages

This is a collection of solutions to the N Queen Problem, the general case of the [8 Queen Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle). Recursive backtracking is employed in all of the solutions. In each folder, instructions on how to run, together with the source code, is provided.

This project is heavily inspired by Joe Wingbermuehle's [maze generation algorithms](https://github.com/joewing/maze). Thanks, Joe!
